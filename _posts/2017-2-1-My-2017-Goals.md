### Background

Target has the concept of Career Competencies which help determine when someone is meeting, exceeding, or under performing based on their job duties.  Below, I've completed my 2017 competencies goals so I can reference throughout the year.  Self Evaluations are on a scale of 1-10 (1 being not good, 10 being you should be CEO).  Goal level is where you'd like to be
