In the true nature of why I started this blog, I'm going to document how to get started.  But first, bare with me while I give you the "why I started doing this" memo...

So, I started this because I've been an engineer for all but 9 months now and have had my fair amount of struggles getting started.  Plus, I'm in a leadership position where I interview more experienced individuals and it seems like everyone has a site similar to this. Well, there you have it and now onto how to create a site.

Let's get started... directions assume you are using a Mac like a pro...

1. Create a GitHub account if you haven't already.  It's free, so no issue.
2. Follow these steps documented here: https://pages.github.com/ to create a new repository.
3. Fork/Clone the jalpc_jekyll_theme repository:
```
  $ git clone https://github.com/<your githubname>/jalpc_jekyll_theme.git
```
4. Navigate into the repository and download jekyll
```
  $ gem install jekyll bundler
```
5. Now copy the contents of the jekyll clone and put in the repository you created in step 1
6. Check in all the code and GitHub will host the site for you.

It's that simple.  Now have fun and customize to your needs.
